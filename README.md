# Learning-Roadmap 📖🗺
A repository to keep track of my roadmap to being a more knowledgeable developer

## Why I decided to make this? 🤔
I wanted to make this because I felt lost, without a clear direction of where I wanted to take my career. I want to be the best developer I can be, which means I need a roadmap.

## My intentions with this roadmap ➡️
I intend to become a more proficient developer than I am as of August 26th, 2018. Currently, I feel proficient with JavaScript (React, Redux, Node, Express), HTML, and CSS. But I lack a lot of computer science fundamentals. My goal is to use this roadmap to guide my learning inside & outside of the office.

### The Roadmap 🗺 
The following items have been taken from these guides:
- @p1xt's [Computer Science and Web Development - comprehensive](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/cs-wd.md)
- @freeCodeCamp's [curriculum](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)
- @ossu's [computer science degree](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)
