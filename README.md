# Learning-Roadmap 📖🗺
A repository to keep track of my roadmap to being a more knowledgeable developer

## Why I decided to make this? 🤔
I wanted to make this because I felt lost, without a clear direction of where I wanted to take my career. I want to be the best developer I can be, which means I need a roadmap.

## My intentions with this roadmap ➡️
I hope to become a "senior" developer within the next five years. My goal is to use this roadmap to guide my learning inside & outside of the office.

### The Roadmap 🗺 
The following items have been taken from these guides:
- @p1xt's [Computer Science and Web Development - comprehensive](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/cs-wd.md)
- @freeCodeCamp's [curriculum](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)
